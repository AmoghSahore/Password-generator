This is a basic python project which uses the 'random' module of python to generate secure passwords for the users.
All you have to do is download this python program and run it on your device. Every execution of this program will tend to create a new password every time which is not easy to crack.

In order to change the requirements of the password, the user can edit the python code to suit their needs.
